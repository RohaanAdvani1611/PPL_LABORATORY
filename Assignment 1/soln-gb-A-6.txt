  
Good!  You are  half-way there.  Now you  know about  how C  is translated  into
GIMPLE.  Let's see how good you are at understanding the C to GIMPLE conversion.

The following  is a CFG  dump of a somewhat  meaningful little program.  Can you
predict the  output of  the program just  by looking at  the GIMPLE  dump? Well,
maybe or  maybe not. But your  task is to  find the corresponding C  program for
which gcc-4.7.2 generated this GIMPLE dump.


---------------------------------------
A-6 GIMPLE CFG DUMP (file A-6-cfg-dump)
---------------------------------------
#include <stdio.h>

void main()
{
    int i, j;
    for(i = 2; i <= 100; i++) {
        for(j = 2; j < i; j++) {
            if(i % j == 0)
                break;
        }
        if(i == j) {
            printf("%d \n", i);
        }
   }            
}

The output is a list of prime numbers up to 100.
